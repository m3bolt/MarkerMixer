# MarkerMixer
Marker mixer/blender for dying filament with permanent markers before it enters the hotend

This is a WIP collaboration.

The marker mixer is designed to use servos to slide markers in out and of a central filament path. It is an evolution of and directly inspired by Youtuber Makers Muse who designed a manual version.

Assembly instructions to follow after it is removed from WIP status.
