# Marker Mixer 
## Solenoid Version

The modularity of the marker mixer lets us use different types of marker mounts, this version uses solenoids. 

## BOM

There are a few parts required, the following list is per 1 marker holder. Most setups will need 3.

• Solenoid, in our case it's this one https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R862GD7?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details

• M4 x 10-12mm screw. This is used for attaching the solenoid to the slider

• 4x M3 x 6mm screws. Two for attaching the Solenoid Clamp and two for attaching the Body Top

• 2x M3 x 8-10mm screws. These are for attaching the marker body to the hub.

• MOSFET for triggering the solenoid, we use P55NF06 MOSFETS but others may work. You will need 1 for each marker

That's it!
